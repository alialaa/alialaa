				<h2>Who am I? (TL;DR version)</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Ali Alaa. I am a front-end web developer based in Cairo, Egypt. I have been
					working in the field for around{' '}
					{new Date().getFullYear() - 2012} years. I am currently focusing on creating online learning
					content. I publish{' '}

				<h3>The Beginnings</h3>
				<p>
					I was first introduced to web development during my time studying telecommunications
					engineering around 2010. During that time I discovered <a href="https://themeforest.net"
						>themeforest</a
					>
					and I was intrigued by some of the WordPress templates that I saw there. Shortly after, I decided
					to start learning web development and WordPress in parallel with my university studies. I learned
					through online tutorials and courses. As far as I remember,{' '}
					<a href="https://tutsplus.com">tutsplus</a> &{' '}
					<a href="https://www.lynda.com">Lynda</a> were my two biggest sources of learning.

				<h3>First Milestone</h3>
				<p>
					At the time I graduated university; I was able to get a jQuery plugin & a WordPress
					template published on themeforest. This of course happened after multiple rejections which
					looking back I consider were important for my development. This was a huge milestone for
					me. Although my theme didn&apos;t do well, but I knew that I have reached a good point in
					my career.
				</p>
				<p>
					During that time I was looking for a job and I wasn&apos;t yet decided on which field I
					would like to carry on with. I was applying for jobs for both telecommunications and web
					development fields.

			<div class="job-text grid-item">
				<h3>First Job</h3>
				<p>
					I got my first job at a web development agency in 2014. I worked on tons of WordPress
					projects. At the same time I was still working in my free time on WordPress themes for
					themeforest. I managed to publish another WordPress theme and a WordPress plugin. However,
					I started to lose interest in WordPress stuff and I was more interested in learning more
					about JavaScript and different front-end aspects that I wasn&apos;t aware of like
					accessibility, JS frameworks and hybrid mobile application development. Luckily, that was
					also the direction of the agency I worked for. We were getting more web app and hybrid
					mobile app sort of projects.

					Publishing themes on themeforest also wans&apos;t a very good idea if you are an
					individual. To succeed on such a competitive marketplace, you have to have a team of
					designers, developers and customer support and that wasn&apos;t possible for me at the
					time. So I decided to quit themeforest and focus more on expanding my front-end
					development knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					Working at an agency was a really beneficial step in my career. Working on real-life
					projects, dealing with clients and collaborating with different teams taught me a lot. But
					after a while I decided to take my next step and start freelancing.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="freelancing-text grid-item">
				<h3>Freelancing</h3>
				<p>
					After few years of having a regular job, I gained a lot of experience and worked on a lot
					of big projects. Nevertheless, I started getting tired of the routine. I felt like I
					needed a new challenge at this point. So I decided to start freelancing. When I took that
					decision, I had no idea what to do and how to find clients. I started applying for jobs on <a
						href="https://www.upwork.com">Upwork</a
					>. And given my empty Upwork profile, It took me around 6 months to be noticed and hired
					by a client. It was a very difficult period in my life. I was barely getting any income
					and I started to doubt my decision. But during these 6 months I did a lot of things that
					helped me a lot later. I created a website for myself which was{' '}
					<a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/933730758547660800"> shared by Wes Bos </a>
					,{' '}
					<a href="https://medium.com/@alialaa">wrote some articles on medium</a>, created a CSS
					grid cheat sheet{' '}
					<a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/856989478212313088">
						which was shared by Smashing Magazine
					</a>{' '}
					and so on. All of that gave a bit of exposure and helped me have some stuff to show the clients
					that I was applying for their jobs. Since I got my first job, things went a lot better for
					me and I was able to get clients easier. A lot of times I didn&apos;t have to search for jobs,
					clients started to get in touch with me either from an article I wrote or from my Upwork profile.

				<h3>Course Creation</h3>
				<p>
					After about a year of freelancing; I was thinking about something new to do. One of the
					things that I thought of was creating online courses. I wasn&apos;t sure if I was gonna be
					able to do it. I haven&apos;t done anything like that before. But after some research and
					demos, I decided that I am gonna give it a try. And I started preparing for my{' '}
					<a href="/courses/wordpress">first course</a> which was about creating WordPress themes. It
					took me a very long time to prepare and record that course. I was very unconfident about how
					I was doing things and I kept re-recording and re-editing a lot. But after the first few sections
					I started to get used to it and I finally released the course on Udemy.
				</p>
				<p>
					I struggled a bit at the beginning with sales, but after a while the course started
					getting some traction and also some good reviews. Few months later I decided to do more
					courses. Although it&apos;s a very stressful process to create and edit a course on your
					own; but I really enjoyed the outcome of it. Helping students and getting positive
					feedback is a really satisfying experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have made <a href="/courses">a handful of courses</a> so far and I really enjoyed each one
					of them. When you create a course about a certain topic, you really learn a lot about this
					topic. When you are willing to explain something to people, you have to have a very deep understanding
					of it. And that makes you learn things wouldn&apos;t have learned otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently focusing on creating more courses. I am also planing to do free tutorials
					on{' '}
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-VVCGLQZv6IQWTKyVlnjg"> youtube </a>{' '}
					and write more <a href="/blog">articles here on my website</a> 🙂.
