00:04.190 --> 00:06.470
Welcome to modern web animations.

00:06.680 --> 00:12.650
In this course we are going to learn everything about web animations using only modern browsers, APIs

00:12.650 --> 00:14.630
and no third party libraries.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.000
I'm Ali, your guide for this course.

00:18.360 --> 00:25.110
As a seasoned front end web developer with a passion for creating user interfaces and interactive experiences,

00:25.110 --> 00:28.890
I have spent years building web and mobile applications.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.950
I am also passionate about creating educational content that has been highly rated by thousands.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.150
I am excited to embark on this animation's journey with you.

00:39.750 --> 00:46.500
CSS animations and transitions have been a web development staple for a while, but recently modern

00:46.500 --> 00:51.930
browsers have also introduced new APIs that take web animations to the next level.

00:52.470 --> 00:59.520
These APIs offer developers more control, flexibility, and powerful features for creating even more

00:59.520 --> 01:01.800
impressive and dynamic animations.

01:02.370 --> 01:07.500
By the end of this course, you will be a master of modern Web Animation APIs.

01:07.530 --> 01:14.490
You will have a deep understanding of the new web animations, JavaScript API, scroll driven animations,

01:14.490 --> 01:16.500
and the view Transitions API.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.380
To ensure everyone is on the same page.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.940
We will begin with a refresher on CSS animations and transitions.

01:25.540 --> 01:30.610
This section is valuable for beginners and those who want to brush up their skills.

01:30.940 --> 01:36.520
We are going to discuss everything about CSS animations and transitions in great detail.

01:37.740 --> 01:44.880
Sometimes, however, CSS animations can feel restrictive, especially when it comes to complex animations

01:44.880 --> 01:47.700
or dynamically changing animation properties.

01:48.060 --> 01:53.790
So in the second section we are going to discover the Web Animations JavaScript API.

01:54.390 --> 02:00.870
The Web Animations API unlocks the power of the browser's animation engine for developers.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.920
It allows us to construct animations and control their playback with JavaScript and not only CSS.

02:08.610 --> 02:11.250
This allows for more dynamic animations.

02:11.910 --> 02:17.070
The Web Animations API is one of the most performant ways to animate on the web.

02:18.150 --> 02:26.550
In the third section, we will explore a new feature that was added to CSS animations Animation Timelines.

02:26.760 --> 02:33.480
This exciting feature lets you create animations triggered by scrolling progress or an element's visibility

02:33.480 --> 02:34.920
within the viewport.

02:35.700 --> 02:41.760
This opens the door for creating impressive scroll driven animations without having to load any external

02:41.760 --> 02:42.690
libraries.

02:43.730 --> 02:50.330
Finally, we will delve into the View Transitions API, a powerful new browser tool.

02:50.810 --> 02:57.320
This API simplifies creating smooth, animated transitions between different states of your web pages.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.160
Content.

02:59.420 --> 03:05.600
It can be particularly valuable in single page applications when we need to have an animation, when

03:05.600 --> 03:10.700
we navigate between different routes before the View Transitions API.

03:10.730 --> 03:14.390
These kinds of animations were extremely complicated to achieve.

03:15.720 --> 03:22.020
Some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge is the only requirement for this course.

03:22.890 --> 03:27.000
So join modern web animations now and bring your websites to life.
