Welcome to Gutenberg blocks for WordPress & ReactJS developers. In this course you are going to learn

1
00:07.990 --> 00:13.540
everything you need to know in order to create complex blocks and plugins for the new WordPress editor

2
00:13.780 --> 00:15.070
known as Gutenberg.

3
00:16.620 --> 00:19.650
My name is Ali, and I will be instructing you throughout this course.

4
00:20.610 --> 00:26.130
I've been working as a frontend web developer for years, creating WordPress themes and plugins and

5
00:26.130 --> 00:29.130
also JavaScript and ReactJS web applications.

6
00:30.570 --> 00:36.300
This course is designed for WordPress developers who are familiar with ReactJS and Redux and need to

7
00:36.300 --> 00:39.180
learn everything about the new WordPress block editor.

8
00:40.770 --> 00:45.930
At the end of this course, you should be able to use React and Redux in order to create complex blocks

9
00:45.930 --> 00:52.890
from scratch and also add features to the existing block editor UI. Before creating any blocks,

10
00:53.100 --> 00:57.780
we are going to discuss some design guidelines that you need to know before designing a block.

11
00:59.280 --> 01:03.180
Then we are going to discover how UI and data are managed in the block editor,

12
01:04.170 --> 01:10.020
what is the role of React and Redux, how your post is saved in the database and other information that

13
01:10.020 --> 01:13.710
will give you some insights on how the block editor works behind the scenes.

14
01:15.200 --> 01:20.480
Next, we are going to create a boilerplate that we are going to use in order to create blocks throughout

15
01:20.480 --> 01:20.990
the course.

16
01:21.770 --> 01:26.990
In this boilerplate, we are going to use a WordPress package called wp-scripts in order to compile

17
01:26.990 --> 01:30.230
and minify our JavaScript & SASS files.

18
01:31.310 --> 01:38.030
And also, we are going to configure some tools like ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint and husky for an improved

19
01:38.030 --> 01:39.380
development experience.

20
01:41.030 --> 01:42.620
Then we will start building blocks.

21
01:43.070 --> 01:45.440
We're going to start by simple text box block.

22
01:46.250 --> 01:51.440
However, in this simple block, we are going to go through the most common concepts that you will need

23
01:51.440 --> 01:52.520
for creating the block.

24
01:54.770 --> 02:00.050
And then we are going to create a more complex, nested team members block where you are going to be

25
02:00.050 --> 02:06.590
able to add multiple team members, each with an image, a title, a bio and some social media links

26
02:06.590 --> 02:09.620
that you can customize and drag and drop to reorder.

27
02:11.270 --> 02:17.900
We will also discuss dynamic blocks, which are blocks that can generate dynamic content using PHP and

28
02:17.900 --> 02:19.580
not just some static HTML.

29
02:21.920 --> 02:28.370
We will explore the data stores that are based on Redux in the block editor, how to use existing data

30
02:28.430 --> 02:34.300
stores, and how to create our own data stores in order to share data between multiple blocks and components.

31
02:36.350 --> 02:41.260
Then we will see what are the different ways that we can use in order to manage metadata in the block

32
02:41.270 --> 02:41.720
editor.

33
02:42.860 --> 02:49.610
We will see how to modify the existing block editor's UI and add our own components in the sidebar and also

34
02:49.610 --> 02:53.630
how to create a brand new sidebar and control our meta fields inside of it.

35
02:55.370 --> 03:01.520
Finally, we are going to take a quick look on various topics like context, templates, patterns, formats,

36
03:01.520 --> 03:03.710
filters and internationalization.

37
03:05.630 --> 03:11.180
In order to get the most out of this course, you need to have some WordPress development experience.

38
03:12.260 --> 03:17.000
JavaScript, preferably ES6 and later versions, is also required.

39
03:18.140 --> 03:24.590
You should also be familiar with basic ReactJS concepts. The things like components, state, hooks

40
03:25.280 --> 03:28.280
and other basic React concepts should not be new to you.

41
03:29.720 --> 03:31.450
Redux knowledge is also ideal.

42
03:32.420 --> 03:34.550
Not all blocks will require Redux knowledge,

43
03:34.820 --> 03:39.940
however, in some blocks, redux will be used heavily. So it would be ideal if you are familiar with

44
03:39.970 --> 03:44.960
Redux concepts like stores, actions, action creators and reducers.

45
03:46.980 --> 03:51.900
So make sure to take a look at the course description and also the free preview videos, and I look

46
03:51.900 --> 03:53.370
forward to seeing you inside.
