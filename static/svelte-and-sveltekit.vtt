Welcome to the Complete Guide to svelte and Svelte KITT.

00:08.890 --> 00:14.740
In this course, we are going to learn everything about building web components with svelte and high

00:14.740 --> 00:18.070
performance web applications with svelte kit.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.080
My name is Ali.

00:20.110 --> 00:25.960
I have been working as a front end web developer for years, creating web and mobile applications and

00:25.960 --> 00:32.230
also publishing online educational content that has received thousands of positive reviews.

00:33.610 --> 00:39.940
At the end of this course, you will be able to build Web components using svelte and using svelte kit.

00:39.970 --> 00:46.720
You will be able to build high performance server side rendered web applications that can be fully functional

00:46.720 --> 00:49.270
even without having JavaScript enabled.

00:50.470 --> 00:55.090
The first nine sections in this course is dedicated to discussing svelte.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.840
We are going to discuss everything about svelte from scratch.

00:59.080 --> 01:05.710
We will start by creating simple components and then we are going to gradually progress into more complex

01:05.710 --> 01:08.200
components and more advanced topics.

01:09.130 --> 01:13.000
The next seven sections will be dedicated to Svelte Kit.

01:13.480 --> 01:20.170
We are going to discuss everything about svelte kit from how to create pages, layouts, how to load

01:20.170 --> 01:26.650
data on the server and on the client, how to handle errors, how to use environment variables, how

01:26.650 --> 01:33.580
to post data to your server in a progressively enhanced way, how to deploy your app and more topics

01:33.580 --> 01:39.730
that will eventually allow you to build a high performance server side rendered app that can work without

01:39.730 --> 01:42.040
having JavaScript enabled in the browser.

01:42.790 --> 01:48.310
And in the final section, we are going to build an app that is going to bring everything that we've

01:48.310 --> 01:49.360
learned together.

01:49.870 --> 01:56.650
In this final section, we are going to build a mini Spotify clone using svelte and svelte Kit and the

01:56.650 --> 02:03.370
Spotify API, and you can see a demo of the apps that we are going to be building in the free videos.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.660
Good JavaScript knowledge is the only requirement that you need in order to take this course.

02:13.230 --> 02:19.860
And basic typescript knowledge is also preferable as we are going to be using typescript with svelte

02:19.860 --> 02:20.370
git.

02:21.390 --> 02:22.350
So join us now.

02:22.350 --> 02:27.870
If you would like to learn this world framework from scratch and build high performance web applications

02:27.870 --> 02:29.220
with wealth kit.
