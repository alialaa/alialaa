Welcome to The Complete Guide to Svelte and Sveltekit.

00:03.440 --> 00:09.120
In this course, we are going to explore everything from building reactive UI components with svelte

00:09.160 --> 00:13.640
to creating full stack, high performance web applications with Sveltekit.

00:21.200 --> 00:27.880
My name is Ali and I've been working as a web developer for years, creating both web and mobile applications

00:28.280 --> 00:35.280
and sharing my knowledge through online courses that have received thousands of positive reviews over

00:35.280 --> 00:35.640
the years.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.920
I have tried many libraries and frameworks, but when I discovered svelte, it instantly became one

00:41.920 --> 00:42.960
of my favorites.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.040
I truly enjoy working with it and even built my personal website with it.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.120
I created this course to share everything I've learned about Svelte and Sveltekit.

00:53.800 --> 01:01.400
By the end, you will be able to build reusable reactive components with svelte and build fast, SEO

01:01.400 --> 01:04.640
friendly full stack web applications with Sveltekit.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.630
This course is divided into two parts.

01:08.470 --> 01:12.190
The first eight sections in this course are dedicated to svelte.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.390
We are going to discuss everything about svelte from scratch.

01:15.790 --> 01:22.430
We will discuss signal based reactivity, which is the way svelte uses in order to efficiently update

01:22.470 --> 01:23.870
certain parts of the Dom.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.390
And then we will start by creating simple components.

01:27.590 --> 01:33.990
And then we are going to gradually progress into more complex components and more advanced topics like

01:33.990 --> 01:41.150
deep state reactivity, universal reactivity, the context API, animations, transitions, and more.

01:42.430 --> 01:45.230
The remaining sections are all about sveltekit.

01:45.790 --> 01:52.790
While svelte helps you build components, Sveltekit lets you build full applications with routing,

01:53.110 --> 01:59.470
server side rendering, and back end capabilities, allowing you to create full stack applications.

02:00.230 --> 02:06.750
We're going to discuss everything about Sveltekit from how to create pages layouts, how to load data

02:06.750 --> 02:13.140
on the server and on the client, how to handle errors, How to submit data to your server in a progressively

02:13.140 --> 02:14.020
enhanced way.

02:14.860 --> 02:21.860
We will also set up a Postgres database and interact with it with drizzle ORM in order to create a full

02:21.860 --> 02:23.140
stack application.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.060
In addition to that, we are going to handle authentication and authorization.

02:28.660 --> 02:32.700
And finally deploy our app to different hosting services.

02:34.540 --> 02:41.220
You will gain the skills to build a robust, fast and secure application that work even without JavaScript.

02:43.540 --> 02:48.860
The main requirements for this course is JavaScript and also some TypeScript.

02:49.220 --> 02:56.460
However, we will also use PostgreSQL and drizzle ORM in few sections, so basic knowledge of SQL will

02:56.460 --> 02:57.140
be helpful.

02:57.660 --> 03:03.700
We will write queries, join tables and stuff like that, but I won't be covering SQL from scratch.

03:06.580 --> 03:12.260
So if you are excited to learn Svelte and Sveltekit and want to start building high performance modern

03:12.260 --> 03:16.180
web applications, join us now and I will see you inside the course.
