Welcome to Building Tic-Tac-Toe with React Native and TypeScript, where we are going to build a single

1
00:07.620 --> 00:14.310
player tic tac toe game with an unbeatable bot and the realtime multiplayer game using a GraphQL API

2
00:14.610 --> 00:17.640
that we are going to build using AWS Amplify.

3
00:18.600 --> 00:21.630
My name is Ali and I will be instructing you throughout this course.

4
00:22.350 --> 00:27.540
I've been working as a front-end web developer for over seven years and few years ago I started building

5
00:27.550 --> 00:29.660
hybrid mobile apps using React Native.

6
00:30.330 --> 00:36.120
During these years, I have contributed to building multiple large scale React Native applications.

7
00:37.180 --> 00:42.490
In this case, we are going to use Expo, which is a tool that makes developing React Native applications

8
00:42.490 --> 00:45.580
a lot easier, to create a tic tac toe game.

9
00:46.600 --> 00:49.540
Creating tic tac toe might seem simple;

10
00:49.540 --> 00:52.240
However, what we are going to learn is not just about the game.

11
00:52.840 --> 00:56.790
You will also learn how to use TypeScript in a React Native application.

12
00:57.370 --> 01:01.270
In addition to that, we are also going to create a bot for our single player game.

13
01:01.870 --> 01:06.370
And this bot won't just play random moves, but it will be smart enough to be unbeatable.

14
01:07.480 --> 01:13.900
Also, we are going to create a real-time multiplayer game using a GraphQL API that we will create

15
01:13.900 --> 01:16.750
using an Amazon web service called Amplify.

16
01:18.290 --> 01:24.580
We are also going to learn how to properly use Expo to send push notifications and how to monetize, build

17
01:24.580 --> 01:28.570
and publish your app on Apple's App Store or Google Play store.

18
01:29.770 --> 01:32.860
So let's take a quick look on how this course is structured.

19
01:34.630 --> 01:40.160
Section 1 is an optional section for students without or with limited TypeScript knowledge.

20
01:40.930 --> 01:46.420
We are going to have a very quick introduction to TypeScript and we are going to discuss things like

21
01:46.420 --> 01:49.960
basic types, types, interfaces and generics.

22
01:51.390 --> 01:57.360
In Section 2, we are going to discover the difference between Expo and vanilla React Native, and

23
01:57.360 --> 02:03.240
then we are going to install Expo, create a new Expo project and run it on a physical device, Android

24
02:03.240 --> 02:10.290
emulator and the iOS simulator. In Section 3, we are going to set up some tools that will be very helpful

25
02:10.290 --> 02:11.190
in our workflow.

26
02:11.880 --> 02:18.290
These tools include TypeScript itself, ESLint, Prettier and Husky.

27
02:18.300 --> 02:24.810
In Section 4, we are going to do some general setup for our application, including things like loading fonts, creating

28
02:24.960 --> 02:28.560
custom text component, setting up navigation and more.

29
02:30.090 --> 02:36.930
In Section 5, we are going to build our single player game and this includes: the UI, the bot player,

30
02:37.500 --> 02:44.700
adding sounds and haptics, creating a settings page to choose difficulty and other options and persisting

31
02:44.700 --> 02:48.750
these settings on the phone using React context and AsyncStorage.

32
02:49.770 --> 02:58.500
Section 6 will just be an introduction to AWS Amplify and some other AWS concepts like IAM.

33
02:58.500 --> 03:01.470
We will also install Amplify and set it up in our project.

34
03:02.980 --> 03:09.700
In Section 7, we are going to use AWS Cognito, which is a service that comes with Amplify and we are

35
03:09.700 --> 03:12.070
going to use it to add authentication in our app.

36
03:13.030 --> 03:20.860
This includes login, register, OTP confirmation, resend password, reset password, forgot password

37
03:20.860 --> 03:21.460
and more.

38
03:22.870 --> 03:28.330
Next, in Section 8, we are going to cover creating a GraphQL API using Amplify.

39
03:29.970 --> 03:36.060
This API will be used for the multiplayer game, and we are going to create all the necessary database

40
03:36.060 --> 03:42.540
models, GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions and also some lambda functions that we will

41
03:42.540 --> 03:47.730
use in our multiplayer game.

42
03:47.760 --> 03:51.390
After completing our API, we are going to move to Section 9 and start building our UI.

43
03:52.080 --> 03:59.250
This includes listing games, paginating games, searching for players, starting a new game and handling

44
03:59.250 --> 04:00.770
game updates in real time.

45
04:02.360 --> 04:09.560
Section 10 would be entirely dedicated to sending push notifications with Expo.

46
04:09.560 --> 04:10.440
Sending notifications may seem simple.

47
04:11.000 --> 04:16.070
However, there are a lot of stuff that need to be handled that we will discover in this section.

48
04:16.700 --> 04:23.480
Eventually, we will be able to send a notification to a player when he is invited to a new game.

49
04:23.480 --> 04:24.240
In Section 11,

50
04:24.260 --> 04:28.990
we will see how simple it is to add ads in your game using Google AdMob.

51
04:30.020 --> 04:35.960
And finally, in Section 12, we will discover how smooth building and publishing your app with Expo

52
04:35.960 --> 04:36.380
is.

53
04:36.990 --> 04:42.950
We will build our apps for Android and iOS and publish our builds to the App Store and Play Store.

54
04:44.750 --> 04:49.010
In order to be comfortable watching this course, you should have JavaScript knowledge.

55
04:50.180 --> 04:50.680
TypeScript

56
04:50.690 --> 04:52.370
knowledge is also preferable.

57
04:52.670 --> 04:55.820
However, we are going to cover the basics in the first section.

58
04:57.080 --> 04:59.540
React basic knowledge is also required.

59
05:00.050 --> 05:06.740
So you should be familiar with functional components, hooks, context, state and other basic React

60
05:06.740 --> 05:07.340
concepts.

61
05:08.810 --> 05:11.610
This is also not a beginners React Native course.

62
05:11.990 --> 05:15.550
So at least some basic React Native concepts are required.

63
05:16.490 --> 05:22.400
So you should know things like what's a view in React Native, what's a touchable component, how to style

64
05:22.400 --> 05:25.430
your views and other basic React Native concepts.

65
05:26.580 --> 05:33.470
Also, basic GraphQL concepts are required so you should know what our queries, subscriptions and mutations,

66
05:33.860 --> 05:38.780
how to write a graphical request and the difference between GraphQL and Rest API.

67
05:40.100 --> 05:45.020
We are also going to use some Amazon Web Services so it's not required.

68
05:45.020 --> 05:50.960
But if you're familiar with things like lambda function, DynamoDB it would just be an extra

69
05:51.500 --> 05:51.890
However,

70
05:51.890 --> 05:53.900
we are going to do everything from scratch.

71
05:55.300 --> 06:02.980
A Mac OS machine is required only if you need to run your app on the iOS simulator or publish your app

72
06:02.980 --> 06:03.800
to the App Store.

73
06:04.480 --> 06:10.690
Other than that, you can follow the course with any other OS and any physical iOS or Android device.

74
06:11.830 --> 06:16.120
For the multiplayer part of the course and AWS account is required.

75
06:16.780 --> 06:23.200
You will have to enter your credit card information to create an account. However you are probably not going

76
06:23.200 --> 06:25.600
to be charged just by watching the course.

77
06:26.620 --> 06:33.790
You will get a free monthly usage for most AWS services and it's very unlikely to consume that free

78
06:33.790 --> 06:36.190
usage just by following the course.

79
06:37.570 --> 06:43.030
And finally, if you would like to publish your apps on the App Store or Play Store, you will have

80
06:43.030 --> 06:50.500
to have an Apple developer account for iOS, which costs $99 per year and a Google

81
06:50.500 --> 06:55.660
developer account for Android, which costs a one time fee of $25.

82
06:58.050 --> 07:03.450
But of course, this is only if you would like to publish your apps and it's not going to be necessary

83
07:03.450 --> 07:11.100
during development. So make sure to check the course description and also the free preview videos.

84
07:11.100 --> 07:16.410
In the free preview videos will find a demo of the app that we are going to create to make sure

85
07:16.410 --> 07:17.350
to check that out.

86
07:17.370 --> 07:19.290
And I look forward to seeing you inside.
